This portfolio was created using bootstrap classes to make each page and the images responsive using only a minimal amount of media queries.

Each page has two containers.  The first container, container-fluid, is used to place a background image around my nested container which holds all of the content.
 
My About Me page contains two rows. The first row is my title "About Me" and links to my resume, github page, and linkin profile.  This row consists of one column.  The second row also consists of one column and contains my image and my paragraphs. I chose to 
put my image and my paragraphs inside the same column as opposed to making two seperate columns so that the paragraphs would wrap around the image on larger screens.  On smaller screens, I used a media query
class to unwrap my paragraphs so that the image can sit ontop of the paragraphs.  I used the Bootstrap img-fluid class to make the image adjust when the page is viewed on a smaller screen.

My portfolio page consists of four rows.  The top row is one column long for my title.  The other rows contain two columns. Each column contains an image link to projects. On larger screens, there will be two image links side-by-side.
on smaller screens, the image links go underneath one another. I used Bootstrap flex classes to place the name of each project on top of the image link and to center them.  

My contact page consists of 5 rows- one for each element of the form.  Each row consists of one column.  I used coding from the Bootstrap website to create this form,
so it resizes very nicely for smaller screens.  

I created my navbar with code found on the Boostrap website and customized it to fit the look that I was going for.  I used media queries to improve the look of the navbar
on smaller screens so that it forces the nav links below my name.
